# Persistent Storage Implementation for Review Decisions

## Status: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED

### Date: 2025-08-05

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Model Created
Added `ReviewDecision` table to PostgreSQL with columns:
- `review_id` - Unique review identifier
- `order_id` - Link to orders table
- `customer_email` - Customer who sent the order
- `subject` - Email subject line
- `confidence_score` - AI confidence level
- `items` - JSON array of requested items
- `search_results` - JSON array of matched inventory
- `decision` - approve/reject/clarify/alternative/defer
- `status` - Final status after decision
- `review_notes` - Human reviewer notes
- `alternative_items` - Suggested alternatives (if any)
- `reviewed_by` - Reviewer identifier
- `reviewed_at` - When review was completed
- `review_duration_seconds` - Time taken to review
- `priority` - urgent/high/medium/low
- `created_at` - When review was created

### 2. Auto-Save on Decision
The `submit_review_decision` method now:
1. Updates the in-memory review
2. Creates/finds the related Order record
3. Saves the complete review decision to database
4. Logs success/failure

### 3. Retrieval Method Added
New method `get_review_history_from_db` allows:
- Pagination (limit/offset)
- Filter by customer email
- Filter by decision type
- Ordered by most recent first

## How It Works

### When You Make a Decision:
```
User clicks "Submit Decision" ‚Üí 
  ‚Üí Updates in-memory review
  ‚Üí Saves to review_decisions table
  ‚Üí Links to orders table
  ‚Üí Returns success
```

### Database Flow:
```python
# On decision submission
review_decision = ReviewDecision(
    review_id=request_id,
    decision=decision,
    reviewed_at=datetime.now(),
    # ... all review details
)
session.add(review_decision)
session.commit()
```

## Testing the Persistence

### 1. Process and Review an Order
1. Go to http://127.0.0.1:7860
2. Process an order email
3. Go to Human Review tab
4. Make a decision (approve/reject/etc)

### 2. Check Database
```bash
# Check if decision was saved
python check_database_reviews.py

# Or query PostgreSQL directly
psql -U postgres -d factory_automation
SELECT review_id, decision, status, reviewed_at FROM review_decisions;
```

### 3. Restart System and Check
The reviews persist across system restarts:
```bash
# Restart system
pkill -f "python.*run_factory"
python run_factory_automation.py

# Check database again
python check_database_reviews.py
```

## Current Behavior

### ‚úÖ What's Saved:
- All review decisions (approve/reject/clarify/alternative)
- Complete review context (items, search results)
- Decision metadata (who, when, how long)
- Links to order records

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Deferred Reviews:
- Stay in pending queue (not saved to DB)
- Only saved when final decision is made

### üîÑ In-Memory vs Database:
- In-memory: Current session's pending/completed reviews
- Database: Permanent record of all decisions

## API Usage

### Save happens automatically on decision:
```python
# In HumanInteractionManager.submit_review_decision()
# No extra code needed - it auto-saves!
```

### Retrieve review history:
```python
manager = HumanInteractionManager()

# Get last 50 reviews
history = manager.get_review_history_from_db(limit=50)

# Get reviews for specific customer
history = manager.get_review_history_from_db(
    customer_email="customer@example.com"
)

# Get only approved reviews
history = manager.get_review_history_from_db(
    decision_filter="approve"
)
```

## Benefits

1. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all decisions
2. **Analytics**: Can analyze decision patterns
3. **Compliance**: Permanent record for accountability
4. **Recovery**: Reviews persist across restarts
5. **Reporting**: Can generate reports from database

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Add Indexes**: For faster queries on large datasets
2. **Archive Old Reviews**: Move old reviews to archive table
3. **Add Metrics**: Dashboard showing review statistics
4. **Export Reports**: Generate PDF/Excel reports
5. **Backup Strategy**: Regular database backups

The persistent storage is now fully operational and will save all review decisions automatically!
