# Session 18: Database Cleanup and UI Investigation

## Session Information
- **Date**: 2025-08-17 Evening
- **Duration**: ~45 minutes
- **Focus**: Database cleanup, Git management, UI debugging, MCP configuration

## Objectives
1. Clean corrupted PostgreSQL and ChromaDB databases
2. Investigate Human Review Dashboard issues
3. Configure MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers
4. Revert code changes to stable state

## Accomplishments

### 1. Database Cleanup ✅
Successfully cleaned both databases:

**PostgreSQL Tables Cleared:**
```
✓ inventory_snapshots - 0 rows
✓ customers - 0 rows
✓ orders - 0 rows
✓ approval_queue - 0 rows
✓ order_items - 0 rows
✓ payments - 0 rows
✓ email_logs - 0 rows
✓ review_decisions - 0 rows
✓ email_patterns - 0 rows
✓ recommendation_queue - 0 rows (was 32 rows)
✓ document_generation_log - 0 rows
✓ inventory_change_log - 0 rows
✓ batch_operations - 0 rows (was 3 rows)
```

**ChromaDB:**
- Removed `./chroma_data` directory completely
- Reinitialized with empty `tag_inventory_stella_smart` collection

### 2. Git Repository Management ✅
Reverted unstable changes:
```bash
# Started at: 992fd21 (2 commits ahead of origin)
# Reverted to: 683e917 (origin/main)
git reset --hard origin/main
```

Current state:
- Synced with origin/main
- Commit: 683e917 "feat(ingestion): Add multi-sheet Excel support with merged cell handling"

### 3. UI Investigation and Issues Identified ⚠️

**Problem Investigation:**
The Human Review Dashboard was showing placeholder/junk data:
- Email preview showed: "Thank you for your order. We are processing it."
- Customer field showed company name instead of email address
- AI Recommendation showed email chain instead of recommendation

**Root Causes Found:**
1. **Email Draft Placeholder**: The `email_draft.body` in recommendation_data contains hardcoded placeholder text
2. **Customer Email**: Database stores company name in `customer_email` field (e.g., "Rajlaxmi Home Products Pvt. Ltd")
3. **Actual Email**: Real customer email (storerhppl@gmail.com) is in the email body text
4. **Inventory Data**: TBALWBL0009N is REAL data from inventory, not placeholder

**Database Structure Discovery:**
```python
recommendation_data = {
    'email_draft': {
        'body': 'Thank you for your order. We are processing it.',  # Placeholder
        'subject': 'Re: Order Request'
    },
    'original_email': {
        'body': 'Dear Sir/Madam...',  # Real email content
        'from': 'Rajlaxmi Home Products Pvt. Ltd'  # Company name, not email
    },
    'orchestrator_analysis': 'Final approval needed...',  # AI recommendation
    'inventory_matches': [...]  # Real inventory data
}
```

### 4. MCP Server Configuration ✅
Successfully configured Playwright MCP server:

```bash
claude mcp add playwright "npx" "@playwright/mcp"
# Added to: /Users/samarsingh/.claude.json
```

Configuration verified:
```json
"mcpServers": {
  "playwright": {
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["@playwright/mcp"]
  }
}
```

## Files Modified
1. `/Users/samarsingh/Factory_flow_Automation/CLAUDE.md` - Updated with session info
2. `/Users/samarsingh/.claude.json` - Added Playwright MCP server
3. Database files removed and recreated

## Issues Resolved
1. ✅ Corrupted database entries cleaned
2. ✅ Git repository synced with origin/main
3. ✅ MCP server configured for browser automation

## Issues Remaining
1. ⚠️ Human Review Dashboard shows placeholder email text
2. ⚠️ Customer email field shows company name
3. ⚠️ Need to reingest inventory data into ChromaDB
4. ⚠️ MCP server not showing in `/mcp` command (may need app restart)

## Key Code Patterns Discovered

### Extracting Real Customer Email
```python
# The real email is in the body text
import re
emails_in_body = re.findall(r'[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+', orig_email["body"])
customer_emails = [e for e in emails_in_body if 'trimsblr' not in e]
actual_email = customer_emails[0]  # storerhppl@gmail.com
```

### Accessing Orchestrator Analysis
```python
# AI recommendation is in orchestrator_analysis
ai_analysis = rec_data.get("orchestrator_analysis", "")
# Not in email_draft which contains placeholder
```

## Testing Commands
```bash
# Test database cleanup
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -c "from factory_automation.factory_database.connection import get_db_session; ..."

# Run application
python3 -m dotenv run -- python3 run_factory_automation.py

# Check MCP configuration
claude mcp list
```

## Performance Metrics
- Database cleanup: ~5 seconds
- ChromaDB removal: Instant
- Git reset: Instant
- MCP configuration: ~2 seconds

## Next Steps
1. Fix Human Review Dashboard to show real data instead of placeholders
2. Reingest inventory data into ChromaDB
3. Test complete workflow with fresh databases
4. Verify MCP server functionality with browser automation

## Session Notes
- User requested revert after UI changes didn't work as expected
- Discovered that what appeared to be "junk data" (TBALWBL0009N) is actually real inventory
- MCP server configuration successful but may need app restart to activate
- Multi-sheet Excel ingestion is working correctly (processes all sheets by default)
