# Python Best Practices Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the Python best practices that have been implemented in the Factory Automation project based on the CLAUDE.md guidelines.

## âœ… Implemented Best Practices

### 1. Code Quality Tools

- **Linting**: Ruff for fast Python linting
- **Formatting**: Black for consistent code formatting
- **Type Checking**: mypy for static type analysis
- **Import Sorting**: isort for organized imports
- **Security**: Bandit for security vulnerability scanning

### 2. Project Structure

```
factory_automation/
â”œâ”€â”€ factory_agents/      # Agent implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ factory_config/      # Configuration management
â”œâ”€â”€ factory_database/    # Database models and connections
â”œâ”€â”€ factory_rag/        # RAG and vector search
â”œâ”€â”€ factory_tests/      # Test files (pytest structure)
â”œâ”€â”€ factory_ui/         # UI components (Gradio)
â””â”€â”€ factory_utils/      # Utility functions and helpers
```

### 3. Configuration Files

#### `.editorconfig`

- Ensures consistent formatting across different editors
- Defines indentation, line endings, and character encoding

#### `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

- Automated code quality checks before commits
- Runs ruff, black, mypy, and security checks
- Prevents committing of secrets and large files

#### `pyproject.toml`

- Centralized project configuration
- Includes tool settings for ruff, black, mypy, isort, and bandit
- Defines project dependencies and metadata

#### `pytest.ini`

- Test configuration with markers for different test types
- Configured test paths and discovery patterns

#### `Makefile`

- Common commands for development workflow
- Targets for linting, testing, formatting, and running the application

### 4. CI/CD Pipeline

#### `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

- Automated testing on push and pull requests
- Runs linting, type checking, tests, and security scans
- Includes PostgreSQL service for integration tests
- Builds and validates distribution packages

### 5. Structured Logging

#### `factory_utils/logging_config.py`

- Structured JSON logging support
- Colored console output for development
- Context-aware logging with extra fields
- Configurable log levels and outputs

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
make install-dev

# Set up pre-commit hooks
make pre-commit

# Run all checks
make all
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Format code
make format

# Run linting and type checks
make lint
make type-check

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage

# Run all checks before committing
make check
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Launch Gradio dashboard
make run-gradio

# Ingest inventory data
make ingest-inventory
```

## ðŸ“‹ Best Practices Checklist

When adding new code, ensure:

- [ ] **Type hints** added to function signatures
- [ ] **Docstrings** provided for modules, classes, and functions
- [ ] **Tests** written for new functionality
- [ ] **Logging** added for important operations
- [ ] **Error handling** implemented with specific exceptions
- [ ] **Configuration** externalized (no hardcoded values)
- [ ] **Security** considerations addressed (no secrets in code)
- [ ] **Code formatting** applied (run `make format`)
- [ ] **All checks pass** (run `make check`)

## ðŸ”§ Tool Commands

### Pre-commit

```bash
# Install hooks
pre-commit install

# Run on all files
pre-commit run --all-files

# Update hooks
pre-commit autoupdate
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run specific test file
pytest factory_automation/factory_tests/test_specific.py

# Run tests with specific marker
pytest -m "not slow"

# Run with verbose output
pytest -vv
```

### Type Checking

```bash
# Check specific module
mypy factory_automation/factory_agents

# Ignore specific errors
# Add to code: # type: ignore[error-code]
```

## ðŸ“Š Metrics and Standards

### Code Quality Goals

- **Test Coverage**: Aim for >80% coverage
- **Type Coverage**: All public APIs should be typed
- **Linting**: Zero linting errors
- **Security**: No high/critical vulnerabilities

### Performance Standards

- **Response Time**: API endpoints < 200ms
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor for memory leaks
- **Startup Time**: Application ready < 10s

## ðŸ”„ Continuous Improvement

1. **Regular Updates**: Update dependencies monthly
2. **Code Reviews**: All PRs require review
3. **Documentation**: Keep docs in sync with code
4. **Monitoring**: Track errors and performance in production
