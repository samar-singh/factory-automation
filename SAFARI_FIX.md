# Safari Connection Fix

## The Issue
Safari cannot open "localhost:7860" - This is a common Safari security restriction.

## The Fix Applied
1. Changed server binding from `0.0.0.0` to `127.0.0.1`
2. Updated all URLs to use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost`
3. Added automatic port selection if 7860 is busy

## To Access the System

### Option 1: Use 127.0.0.1 (Recommended)
```
http://127.0.0.1:7860
```

### Option 2: Use Different Browser
- Chrome: Works with both localhost and 127.0.0.1
- Firefox: Works with both localhost and 127.0.0.1

### Option 3: Safari Settings (If needed)
1. Safari > Preferences > Privacy
2. Uncheck "Prevent cross-site tracking" temporarily
3. Safari > Develop > Disable Local File Restrictions

## Running the System
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python run_factory_automation.py
```

The system will:
- Find an available port (starting from 7860)
- Display the URL as `http://127.0.0.1:PORT`
- Open browser automatically

## Current Status
✅ System is running on http://127.0.0.1:7860
✅ Mock emails disabled
✅ Human review system ready
✅ No infinite loops

Try accessing: **http://127.0.0.1:7860**
