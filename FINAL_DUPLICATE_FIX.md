# Final Duplicate Review Fix

## Root Cause Analysis
The AI agent (GPT-4) was autonomously deciding to call `process_complete_order` multiple times for the same email, creating duplicate reviews.

## Comprehensive Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated AI Prompt (orchestrator_v3_agentic.py)
```python
# Changed from generic "process this email" to specific:
"Process this email ONCE using your available tools"
"IMPORTANT: Only call process_complete_order ONCE per email"
```

### 2. Tool-Level Deduplication
```python
# Added tracking in process_complete_order tool:
self._processed_emails = set()
# Check if email already processed by sender:subject key
```

### 3. Human Manager Deduplication
```python
# Check by email ID and content
# Check by sender + subject combination
# Return existing review instead of creating new
```

## Testing the Fix

1. **Start the system**: Already running on http://127.0.0.1:7861
2. **Process an email**: Use Order Processing tab
3. **Check logs**: Should see only ONE review created
4. **Human Review tab**: Should show only ONE review

## What to Expect
