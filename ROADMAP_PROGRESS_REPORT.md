# Factory Automation System - Roadmap Progress Report

## Project: Garment Price Tag Manufacturing Automation
**Report Date**: 2025-07-26  
**Project Status**: 🟡 In Development (25% Complete)

---

## Executive Summary

The Factory Automation System is being developed to automate order processing for a garment price tag manufacturing factory. The system will use AI agents to process emails, match inventory using multimodal RAG, and manage the complete order lifecycle with human oversight.

### Key Achievements
- ✅ Comprehensive implementation plan created
- ✅ Project foundation established with modern tech stack
- ✅ Basic multi-agent architecture implemented
- ✅ Gradio dashboard UI completed
- ✅ Version control setup with GitHub repository

### Current Blockers
- ⚠️ Gmail API credentials needed
- ⚠️ Database setup required (ChromaDB + PostgreSQL)
- ⚠️ Sample inventory data needed for testing

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks 🔴
1. **API Credentials**: Gmail API access is blocking email functionality
2. **Sample Data**: Need real tag images and Excel inventory for testing

### Medium Priority Risks 🟡
1. **Performance**: Multimodal search optimization needed for production
2. **Accuracy**: Tag matching threshold tuning required

### Low Priority Risks 🟢
1. **Scaling**: Current design supports expected 50 emails/day volume
2. **Costs**: Estimated $100-150/month is within budget

## Next Sprint Goals (Week of 2025-07-26)

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - [ ] Obtain Gmail API credentials
   - [ ] Set up local databases
   - [ ] Create sample inventory data

2. **Development Tasks**
   - [ ] Implement Gmail polling service
   - [ ] Build embedding pipeline
   - [ ] Connect agents with real functionality

3. **Testing Preparation**
   - [ ] Generate test tag images
   - [ ] Create sample email scenarios
   - [ ] Prepare Excel inventory file

---

## Resource Requirements

### Technical Needs
- Gmail API access (Google Cloud Console)
- Together AI API key (for vision models)
- Sample tag images (10-20 varieties)
- Excel inventory template

### Time Estimates
- 6 weeks remaining to complete MVP
- 2 weeks for testing and refinement
- Total: 8 weeks to production

---

## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1**: Obtain necessary API credentials to unblock development
2. **Priority 2**: Create realistic test data for development
3. **Priority 3**: Implement core email-to-inventory matching flow
4. **Consider**: Early user testing with factory staff for UI feedback
