## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks 🔴
1. **API Keys**: OpenAI and Together.ai keys needed to test new features
2. **Sample Data**: Need real tag images and Excel inventory for testing

### Medium Priority Risks 🟡
1. **Performance**: Qwen2.5VL API latency to be tested
2. **Accuracy**: Dual model approach needs validation

### Low Priority Risks 🟢
1. **Scaling**: AI orchestrator handles complex scenarios well
2. **Costs**: Updated to $120-190/month, still within acceptable range
