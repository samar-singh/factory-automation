- ✅ Comprehensive implementation plan created
- ✅ Project foundation established with modern tech stack
- ✅ Basic multi-agent architecture implemented
- ✅ Upgraded to AI-powered orchestrator with function tools pattern
- ✅ Implemented multimodal search with Qwen2.5VL + CLIP
- ✅ Created detailed API setup guide
- ✅ Separated configuration (config.yaml) from secrets (.env)
- ✅ Implemented phased migration strategy for orchestrator v1→v2
- ✅ Added A/B testing framework for orchestrator comparison
- ✅ Gradio dashboard UI completed
- ✅ Version control setup with GitHub repository
- ✅ **NEW**: Reorganized code structure with naming conventions

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks 🔴
1. **API Keys**: OpenAI key invalid, needs immediate update
2. **Sample Data**: Need real tag images and Excel inventory for testing
3. **Dependencies**: openai_agents module not installed

### Medium Priority Risks 🟡
1. **Performance**: Qwen2.5VL API latency to be tested
2. **Accuracy**: Dual model approach needs validation

### Low Priority Risks 🟢
1. **Scaling**: AI orchestrator handles complex scenarios well
2. **Costs**: Updated to $120-190/month, still within acceptable range
