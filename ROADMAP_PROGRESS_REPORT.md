# Factory Automation System - Roadmap Progress Report

## Project: Garment Price Tag Manufacturing Automation

**Report Date**: 2025-08-02
**Project Status**: 🟡 In Development (80% Complete)

---

## Executive Summary

The Factory Automation System is being developed to automate order processing for a garment price tag manufacturing factory. The system now features a working RAG-based inventory matching system with Gmail integration for processing orders from emails and attachments.

**CRITICAL INSIGHT**: While all AI components (GPT-4, Qwen2.5VL, orchestrator) are built and ready, they are NOT connected to the main application flow. The system currently operates using only embeddings-based search, missing the intelligent processing capabilities that have been implemented.

### Key Achievements Today

- ✅ **Stella-400M Migration**: Migrated to advanced embeddings for 20-35% better accuracy
- ✅ **Fixed Gradio Exception**: Resolved data structure mismatch in search results
- ✅ **End-to-End Testing**: Successfully tested complete email → search → decision flow
- ✅ **Collection Management**: ChromaDB now supports multiple collections
- ✅ **Performance Analysis**: Documented trade-offs (2.4s vs 0.1s query time)
- 🔍 **Critical Discovery**: AI components (GPT-4, Qwen2.5VL) exist but are NOT connected to the main flow

### Major Milestones Completed

- ✅ Comprehensive implementation plan created
- ✅ Project foundation established with modern tech stack
- ✅ Multi-agent architecture with OpenAI Agents SDK
- ✅ AI-powered orchestrator with function tools pattern
- ✅ Multimodal search with Qwen2.5VL + CLIP
- ✅ Dual database approach (ChromaDB + PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Configuration management (config.yaml + .env)
- ✅ Gradio dashboard UI completed
- ✅ GitHub repository active

### Current Blockers

- 🚨 **AI Integration Gap**: LLMs/VLMs built but not connected to UI/workflow
- ⚠️ Gmail service account needs domain-wide delegation setup
- ⚠️ Email parsing regex needs improvement for better item extraction
- ⚠️ Type errors in mypy checks need resolution
- ⚠️ Need to implement attachment parsing (Excel/PDF) from emails
- ⚠️ Orchestrator agent not integrated with Gradio dashboard

1. **RAG-Based Inventory System**
   - Excel to ChromaDB ingestion pipeline
   - Multiple embedding models (Stella-400M, E5, all-MiniLM)
   - Natural language order matching
   - Confidence scoring (HIGH >85%, MEDIUM 70-85%, LOW <70%)
   - Stock availability checking

2. **Gmail Integration**
   - Service account authentication
   - Email body parsing
   - Attachment processing (Excel, PDF, Images)
   - Order extraction with regex patterns
   - Urgency detection

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - `test_order_inventory_demo.py` - Complete flow simulation

## Risk Mitigation

### Resolved Risks ✅

- API key issues: All validated and working
- Import errors: Fixed module references
- Database setup: Both ChromaDB and PostgreSQL operational

### Active Risks 🟡

- Gmail authentication: Needs IT admin for domain setup
- Data quality: Create Excel validation before ingestion
- Model downloads: Consider pre-downloading models
- **Scalability**: Current column mapping approach won't handle new formats

---

## Recommendations

1. **URGENT Priority**: Connect AI components to make system actually intelligent
   - Wire orchestrator agent to Gradio UI
   - Enable GPT-4 for email/order parsing
   - Integrate Qwen2.5VL for image analysis
2. **Priority 2**: Fix Excel data quality for better ingestion rate
3. **Priority 3**: Complete Gmail domain setup for live testing
4. **Priority 4**: Implement missing agents (document creator, payment tracker)
5. **Critical**: The system has all AI pieces but runs in "dumb mode" currently
5. **NEW Priority**: Implement AI-powered Excel parser to handle format variations
