- ✅ **478 Items Ingested**: Successfully loaded inventory from 10 Excel files
- ✅ **Real Email Testing**: Tested with SYMBOL ST-057 order, identified parsing needs
- ✅ **Code Quality**: Fixed all linting errors, formatted with black/ruff/isort

### Major Milestones Completed
- ✅ Comprehensive implementation plan created
- ✅ Project foundation established with modern tech stack
- ✅ Multi-agent architecture with OpenAI Agents SDK
- ✅ AI-powered orchestrator with function tools pattern
- ✅ Multimodal search with Qwen2.5VL + CLIP
- ✅ Dual database approach (ChromaDB + PostgreSQL)

## Technical Implementation Status

### Completed Components ✅

1. **RAG-Based Inventory System**
   - Excel to ChromaDB ingestion pipeline
   - Multiple embedding models (Stella-400M, E5, all-MiniLM)
   - Natural language order matching
   - Confidence scoring (HIGH >85%, MEDIUM 70-85%, LOW <70%)
   - Stock availability checking

2. **Gmail Integration**
   - Service account authentication
   - Email body parsing
   - Attachment processing (Excel, PDF, Images)
   - Order extraction with regex patterns
   - Urgency detection

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - `test_order_inventory_demo.py` - Complete flow simulation
   - `test_interactive.py` - Manual query testing
   - `show_inventory.py` - Database inspection
   - `test_email_attachments.py` - Attachment processing demo

4. **Data Processing**
   - Successfully ingested 93 items from 3 Excel files
   - Handles multiple Excel formats and column variations
   - Extracts brand, code, name, stock information
   - Creates searchable text with attributes

### Current System Capabilities

1. **Order Processing Flow**
   ```
   Email → Extract Orders → RAG Search → Confidence Score → Routing Decision
     ↓                        ↓              ↓                   ↓
   Body + Attachments    ChromaDB      Match Quality    Auto/Manual/Alert
   ```

2. **Match Accuracy**
   - VH tags: 55-70% confidence
   - FM tags: 60-65% confidence  
   - Brand-specific searches: Higher accuracy
   - Natural language queries: Working well

3. **Decision Logic**

## Risk Mitigation

### Resolved Risks ✅
- API key issues: All validated and working
- Import errors: Fixed module references
- Database setup: Both ChromaDB and PostgreSQL operational

### Active Risks 🟡
- Gmail authentication: Needs IT admin for domain setup
- Data quality: Create Excel validation before ingestion
- Model downloads: Consider pre-downloading models
- **Scalability**: Current column mapping approach won't handle new formats

---

## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1**: Fix Excel data quality for better ingestion rate
2. **Priority 2**: Complete Gmail domain setup for live testing
3. **Priority 3**: Pre-download Stella-400M for production
4. **Consider**: Early user testing with current capabilities
5. **NEW Priority**: Implement AI-powered Excel parser to handle format variations
