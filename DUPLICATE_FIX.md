# Duplicate Review Fix

## The Issue
Two reviews were being created for one email:
1. REV-20250805-204756-0001 - The actual order review
2. REV-20250805-204825-0002 - A phantom "unknown" review

## Root Causes
1. **Email processed twice**: Once when you paste it in UI, once by monitoring loop
2. **Monitoring loop creating empty reviews**: When no emails found, it still created reviews
3. **No deduplication**: Same email could create multiple reviews

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Deduplication in HumanInteractionManager
```python
# Check by email ID and content
# Prevent same email from creating multiple reviews
# Check both pending and completed reviews
```

### 2. Disable Email Monitoring 
```python
# Skip monitoring if no Gmail agent configured
# Since we're using use_mock_gmail=False
# This prevents empty "unknown" reviews
```

### 3. Content-Based Duplicate Detection
```python
# Check by email_from + subject combination
# Catches duplicates even with different message IDs
# Returns existing review instead of creating new
```

## Result
✅ Only one review per email
✅ No phantom "unknown" reviews
✅ Existing reviews returned if duplicate detected

## To Test
1. Restart the system
2. Process an email
3. Check Human Review queue
4. Should see only ONE review per email

The system now prevents duplicate reviews!
